Tori: "What's up, Maya?"
Maya: "I need to talk to Uncle...is he here?"
Tori: "Maybe...what's it worth to ya?"
Tomo: "Uncle's in the other room, Maya.  He'll be right back..."
Tori: "Shut up, you traitor!  You're cutting my profits here!"
Mouse: "Did you bring us anything from the junkpiles?"
Maya: "Not today, I'm afraid."
Uncle: "Tori, are you causing trouble again?"
Maya: "Uncle, while Grubb and I were out junking today we saw ships in the sky.  They were definitely battleships of the Chosen, heading east...Why are they here again?"
Tori: "What are you so afraid of, Maya?  They probably didn't even see you..."
Uncle: "It doesn't matter.  The last time they came, when Maya was your age, battles between their own tribes happened here."
Maya: "Mother? Mother!?"
Uncle: "Maya?!"
Uncle: "We have to find shelter."
Uncle: "Their ships strayed into our city and many people died, including your parents.  Since then we've been a city of orphans and elders."
Uncle: "It took ten years to rebuild.  We can't let that happen again..."
Tori: "Whatever, I know, I know!  You and Maya have taken care of us ever since...You never let us forget!"
Maya: "You're too young to really remember the devastation."
Uncle: "As your teacher, Azziz, would say...history falls into cycles, my boy."
Uncle: "Mayor?! What's the meaning of this?"
Mayor: "Search the place.  They're hiding in here somewhere..."
Workbot: "Good day, Uncle.  Good day, Miz Maya."
Workbot: "It's a fine day, isn't it?"
Workbot: "Yes, the fresh air would do wonders for you, Uncle..."
Mayor: "Alright, alright; ENOUGH!  We're not here to eat lunch.  We're here to arrest smugglers!"
Uncle: "You'll find no law breakers amongst the Junkers!"
Mayor: "I'm the Mayor of this town, and I can do as I like! Someone is smuggling weapons from the junk piles to a city on the World Shell below.  Now, their greed is going to get us all killed!"
Maya: "This has gone too far.  Get out of our house...now!"
Mayor: "Oh, don't think this is over.  When there's trouble, it's always the Junkers at the heart of it..."
Workbot: "Goodbye!"
Mayor: "Oh, shut up!"
Uncle: "Where did Tori go?"
Maya: "I'm not sure..."
Uncle: "Probably to class...a place you are probably late for as well, Maya.  Perhaps you can ask your teacher about these ships you saw..."
Uncle: "You'd better not be late for class..."
Maya: "Uh, how's your back today, Uncle?"
Uncle: "Don't try to change the subject, Maya..."
Maya: "Why do I have to go to the Temple today?"
Uncle: "You can't know only what you find in the junk piles Maya.  Azziz has much to teach."
Maya: "But he only talks about stuff that happened thousands of years ago!" 
Uncle: "One must know where she came from to see where she is headed..."
Maya: "Tori snuck off pretty quietly..."
Uncle: "He should be on his way to class...If you hurry, you can catch up with him."
Maya: "Do you think Mayor will catch the smugglers?"
Uncle: "He'd better, for all our sakes.  Trading with the other Shells is one thing, but smuggling weapons leads to war...and I doubt we will escape its wrath."
Maya: "Do you think the Chosen ships mean us harm?"
Uncle: "The last time Chosen ships darkened our skies was over ten years ago, during a battle between their own Lords.  As you well know, many of our people were killed in their wake.  These sightings can never mean good tidings...to them, we are mindless animals, to be stepped on blindly, as we do the ants beneath our feet."
Maya: "I won't let that happen again!"
Maya: "Uncle, tell me about the Factory to the north..."
Uncle: "No one has seen those who live inside.   They built the Factory and the pipes that pump water across the desert ages ago.  Our ancestors settled here because they learned to tap the water from the pipes.  In exchange, we ship our excess scrap metal to the factory as sort of a tribute.  They have never caused us trouble, so I wouldn't worry about them."
Maya: "The bread you baked smells good.  Can I have some?"
Uncle: "Ha, ha, it's in the fridge."
Maya: "Grubb's not too happy about how Mayor uses the Workbots."
Uncle: "Well, he knows better than to trust Mayor.  Marduk knows that's why he left the city to live on his own."
Maya: "How did Azziz come to be our teacher?"
Uncle: "He is a wise man.  He comes from other Shells and knows more about the world than I could ever instill in you..."
Maya: "Tori wasn't in class today..."
Uncle: "What?"
Maya: "He asked me to cover for him."
Uncle: "You better find him Maya."
Maya: "Do you think he's in trouble?"
Uncle: "Let's hope not.  Check the water pumping station, he usually hangs out there..."
Uncle: "Maya, they think you're the smuggler..."
Maya: "It's Tori. He's selling weapons he finds in the junk piles..."
Uncle: "He went to hide out in Outlaw Canyon.  You must find him, and set things straight."
Maya: "But, Outlaw Canyon lies past the Pumping station!  I've never gone that far..."
Uncle: "Perhaps Grubb can help you..."
Uncle: "Have you got any more news of Tori?"
Maya: "Do you think Tori is really the smuggler?"
Uncle: "It would not surprise me...his heart is ruled by coin, instead of by conscience."
Grubb: "Long time no see!"
Uncle: "You know you really should stop by more often."
Grubb: "I sometimes lose track of time in the workshop..."
Maya: "I found Tori...has he been here?"
Uncle: "Yes, he said you were going to Shell 3 to fix what he's done..."
Maya: "The Chosen are helping someone take over a city there with the weapons that Tori's been supplying."
Uncle: "The Chosen again...this could be bad for Oasis as well..."
Maya: "Tori, where were you at Lesson?"
Tori: "Um...I had other plans..."
Maya: "Uncle's going to kill you..."
Tori: "Not if you cover for me!!"
Uncle: "Maya, where have you been?"
Maya: "I've been fighting against a Warlord of the Chosen.  He's caused war on several Shells."
Uncle: "Is Oasis safe?"
Maya: "For now...but for how long?"
Uncle: "Perhaps you should seek the advice of Azziz."
Uncle: "Maya, it's always good to have you home."
Uncle: "Perhaps Azziz would know of arcane matters such as these..."
Maya: "What's up with Oasis?"
Uncle: "Mayor has grown powerful with his new Warbot army."
Maya: "How could Mayor have reprogrammed the Workbots?"
Grubb: "My Workbots still operate?"
Uncle: "Yes, but Mayor reprogrammed them to obey only him."
Grubb: "Impossible!  Mayor doesn't have the skill.  He must have had help..."
Corgan: "So, you're Maya's Uncle..."
Uncle: "I am Uncle to all the children of Oasis.  I am sorry for what Tori caused in your city..."
Corgan: "Do not apologize for the actions of others."
Selina: "This city is built from the scrap of my people?"
Maya: "Selina may be a Chosen, but she's a friend."
Uncle: "I hope you're true in your allegiances. Maya is very brave to trust you."
Araym: "I like you, old man.  You're a rascal under that facade of wisdom!"
Uncle: "I have been told that..."
Uncle: "What is it?"
Maya: "He's one of the Underlost of Shell 7."
Uncle: "Amazing!  The sun has never before seen such a creature."
Lobo: "Your city seems a haven of spare parts for one like me."
Uncle: "And yet, Grubb and I could never have conceived of a device such as yourself."
Maya: "Where is Tori these days?"
Uncle: "I think he's been hiding out somewhere."
Maya: "Has there been much Chosen activity?"
Uncle: "Several convoys have been spotted, descending to the Shells below.  But then, nothing.  Maybe they went home."
Maya: "Can Mayor be stopped?"
Uncle: "Not as long as his robotic army is there to protect him."
Maya: "Do the Junkers even put up a fight?"
Uncle: "Have they ever?  They are old and weak, Maya.  They don't like what's happening, but they're afraid to do anything about it..."
Maya: "Is there a way to stop the Workbots?"
Uncle: "I'm afraid that Mayor controls them all from a central computer.  Perhaps that is his weakness..."
Maya: "Have you heard from Tori?"
Uncle: "He's been up to his old mischief.  He sold something to Mayor...some sort of device Mayor used to reprogram the Workbots."
Maya: "Where did he get it?"
Uncle: "In the Factory."
Maya: "No one's ever been in the Factory!"
Uncle: "He said he was going back."
Uncle: "All returns to normal in Oasis, no?"
Uncle: "What do you need, Maya?"
Maya: "If I can't stop Doskias, I'm not sure Oasis will be safe."
Uncle: "I'm afraid that I don't know if I can help...You should talk to Azziz."
Grubb: "The Workbots are functioning normally again."
Uncle: "They're a great help.  Perhaps now, you can move back to Oasis?"
Grubb: "I'll think about it..."
Maya: "What happened to the Mayor?"
Uncle: "The Old Junkers finally rallied and drove him off.  I'm sure we won't see him again."
Maya: "Who will run the City?"
Uncle: "Who ran it before?"
Maya: "Good point..."
Maya: "Septerra is in grave danger."
Uncle: "What's wrong?"
Maya: "A Chosen Lord has doomed us all, in his pursuit for power."
Uncle: "We're isolated here in Oasis...we receive little news from the outside world...perhaps Azziz can help."
Uncle: "Maya!  You're safe!"
Tomo: "Where were you?"
Uncle: "Did you stop the treachery on Shell 3?"
Maya: "That was only the beginning.  A Chosen Warlord known as Doskias has gone against his people, with the belief that he is the savior of Septerra.  I fear his warlike nature will be the destruction of us all!"
Uncle: "I'm ashamed that Tori had a part in all of this - unwittingly perhaps, but a part nonetheless."
Maya: "Doskias has meddled with the balance of the Core.  It may be disastrous for us all."
Uncle: "Azziz would be better able to help in these matters..."
Maya: "You should come in and see Uncle, he asked about you today."
Grubb: "Zero hope, Maya.  I hafta work on Runner's sensors.  Next time...promise."
